        <p>In the meantime, if you're a web design company or a digital marketing company or anyone else who thinks it's a good idea to cold-call people who have just registered a domain, then don't bother wasting your time. Cold-calling is a terrible way to find new customers and we have a strict policy of not doing business with cold-callers.</p>
	<p>To be clear, if we have never done business with you and you call us trying to sell us any kind of service - you are a cold caller and you are wasting everyone's time.</p>
	<p>And to summarise: <strong>DO NOT PHONE US ABOUT THIS DOMAIN.</strong></p>
