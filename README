WHAT IS Perlanet?

  It allows you to aggregate a number of web feeds (both Atom and RSS) and
  to publish a web page and another web feed containing the aggregated
  content.

  Perlanet uses the standard Perl module architecture and can therefore by
  installed using the standard Perl method which, in brief, goes something
  like this:

    gzip -cd Perlanet-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd Perlanet-X.XX
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

  Where X.XX is the version number of the module which you are installing.

  You can also install it using either the 'cpan' or 'cpanp' command line
  programs.

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

  All of the documentation is in POD format. The most useful documentation
  is included with the 'perlanet' program that is part of this

  should be able to read it by typing

    perldoc perlanet

  at a comand prompt.
