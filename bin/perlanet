=head1 NAME

perlanet - command line interface to Perlanet.pm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ perlanet

Or

  $ perlanet config_file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<perlanet> is a command line program for aggregating web feeds (both Atom
and RSS) and publishing a new web page and a new web feed containing the
results of that aggregation.

=head1 COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

C<perlanet> takes one optional command line argument, which is the name of
a configuration file to use. If no filename is given then the program looks
for a file called C<perlanetrc> in the current directory.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

C<perlanet> requires a configuration file which contains details of which
feeds to aggregate and what to do with the results of the aggregation. By
default, C<perlanet> looks for a file called C<perlanetrc> in the current
directory, but this name can be overridden by passing the name of a different
file when calling the program.

The configuration file is in YAML format. YAML is a simple text-based file
format. See L<http://yaml.org/> for further details.

=head2 Configuration Options

The configuration file can contain the following options.

=over 4

=item title

The title of the resulting page and web feed. This option is mandatory.

=item description

The description of the resulting page and web feed. This option is mandatory.

=item url

A URL which will be associated with the resulting page and web feed. This will
usually be the address where the web page will be published. This option is
mandatory.

=item author

The name and email address of the author of the aggregated content. This
item has two sub-items - one each for the name and email address. This option
is mandatory.

=item entries

The maximum number of entries to include in the aggregated content. This option
is mandatory.

=item opml

The system can optionally create an OPML file containing details of the
feeds which are being aggregated. This optional option controls whether or not
this file is created. If it exists, it should be the name of the OPML file
to be created. If an OPML file is being created, then the C<feeds> options
(described below) will all require a C<web> sub-option.

=item page

This mandatory option contains the details of the web page to be created.
There are two sub-options - C<file> gives the name of the file to be created
and C<template> gives the name of a Template Toolkit template which will be
processed in order to create this file. See the section L<Output Template>
for more details on this template, and the web site L<http://tt2.org/> for
more information about the Template Toolkit.

=item feed

This mandatory option contains the details of the web feed to be created.
There are two sub-options - C<file> gives the name of the file to be created
and C<format> gives the format of the output (currently 'Atom' or 'RSS').

=item feeds

This mandatory option gives details of the web feeds to be aggregated. Each
item on the list has one mandatory sub-option and two optional sub-options.
The mandatory sub-option is C<url> which gives the URL of the feed. The
optional sub-option C<title> gives a title which will be prepended to all of
the entry titles taken from that feed. If no title is given, then the title
will be taken from the feed title. The optional C<web> sub-option gives a
web site URL associated with the feed (often the address of the web site that
the feed comes from). This can be used to create a list of the aggregated
sites. The C<web> sub-option becomes mandatory if you are creating an OPML
file.

=head2 Output Template

The web page is created from a Template Toolkit template. This template is
passed two variables.

=over 4

=item feed

This is the XML::Feed object which has been used to create the aggregated
feed. See the L<XML::Feed> documentation for details of the data that is
held in this object.

=item cfg

This is the contents of the configuration file, converted to a (nested)
Perl hash.

=head2 Example Output Template

This is a simple template which uses the C<feed> variable to display details
of the aggregated feeds.

In the future, the Perlanet wiki at L<http://trac.mag-sol.com/perlanet/> will
contain a cookbook of useful ideas to include in the output template.
