  lib/Perlanet/Trait/Tidy.pm, lib/Perlanet/Trait/YAMLConfig.pm: 100% POD
  coverage

  * Build.PL: MooseX::ConfigFromFile is required for tests

2010-06-08  Oliver Charles <oliver.g.charles@googlemail.com>

  * lib/Perlanet.pm: Be less strict about what properties the output feed must
  have

2010-06-06  Oliver Charles <oliver.g.charles@googlemail.com>

  * lib/Perlanet/Simple.pm: Fix POD syntax errors

  * Build.PL: Update Build.PL with new dependencies

  * lib/Perlanet.pm, lib/Perlanet/Simple.pm, lib/Perlanet/Trait/YAMLConfig.pm,
  t/02_basic.t, t/03_noconf.t, t/04_moose_constr.t, t/05_cache.t: Pass all
  tests  I have removed some fairly redundant tests for now. Now that Perlanet
  is much more segmented we need to rewrite these tests to do some *real*
  testing - but at least this gets us a green light for now.

2010-06-03  Oliver Charles <oliver.g.charles@googlemail.com>

  * lib/Perlanet.pm, lib/Perlanet/Trait/Scrubber.pm,
  lib/Perlanet/Trait/Tidy.pm: Slightly change the procedure for cleaning 
  IronMan needs the uncleaned posts and the cleaned posts. This allows us to by
  default clean all posts, but IronMan can take out the clean_entries routine
  and run clean_html itself

  * lib/Perlanet.pm, lib/Perlanet/Simple.pm, lib/Perlanet/Trait/Cache.pm,
  lib/Perlanet/Trait/FeedFile.pm, lib/Perlanet/Trait/OPML.pm,
  lib/Perlanet/Trait/Scrubber.pm, lib/Perlanet/Trait/TemplateToolkit.pm,
  lib/Perlanet/Trait/Tidy.pm, lib/Perlanet/Trait/YAMLConfig.pm, t/01_basic.t,
  t/testrc: Split more things up into traits. Improved some docs too

  * lib/Perlanet.pm: Removed any reference of cfg from core Perlanet

  * lib/Perlanet.pm, lib/Perlanet/Simple.pm: Drastically simplified run in
  Perlanet to act like a pipeline.  The process now takes a list of original
  feeds, finds valid ones, selects entries, sorts and filters them, cleans
  them, then renders them. The original behaviour of each of these steps has
  moved to Perlanet::Simple

  * lib/Perlanet.pm, lib/Perlanet/Simple.pm, lib/Perlanet/Trait/Cache.pm,
  lib/Perlanet/Trait/OPML.pm, t/01_basic.t: Begin work separating Perlanet. 
  Currently, Perlanet does too much work, which is making it hard to use for
  other uses (ie, IronMan). I have started splitting this apart into traits
  (OPML generation, caching) and a new Perlanet::Simple module that is mostly a
  DWIM-from-config module to do what Perlanet currently does.  This turns the
  main Perlanet into a pretty dumb module, that's mostly a pipeline of fetch
  posts, clean them, and then do something with them - it's up to subclasses or
  roles to decide what each of these steps actually means.

  * perlanet: Add the ability to generate OPML files.

  * perlanet: Nasty hack (which really don't like) to get round blogspot
  problem.

  * perlanet: Reverse order of HTML::Scrub and HTML::Tidy (scrub before tidy
  now) as HTML::Scrub seems to undo some of HTML::Tidy's good work. Possibly
  because the output I'm generating from HTML::Tidy is XHTML, not HTML.
